# History of the NBA

This was created as part of a web development/journalism class (MEJO 187) I took at UNC Chapel Hill. The focus of the assignment was to experiment with Javascript in a website about a topic of our choosing. My site covers a brief history of the NBA's evolution from the 1960s until now, and the superstars who defined each decade along the way.
